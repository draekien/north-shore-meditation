Now at her Transcendental Meditation® (TM) Centre in Lane Cove, she draws on her wealth of corporate experience and personal journey to guide others towards finding balance and peace.",
            "With over 3 decades in the pharmaceutical and clinical research industry, Grace has lived and worked in countries such as China, Australia, Japan, Germany, and Singapore, where she held global and regional leadership responsibilities. Over time, she became increasingly aware of the importance of holistic well-being in health practices, prompting her to reflect deeply on her own work and experiences.",
            "After trying to find other ways of settling her mind for more than 10 years, Grace discovered that TM not only gave her the inner peace she needed, but also significantly increased her self-awareness and expanded her counsciousness. This profound shift brought her tremendous benefits in her personal and professional development that goes beyond health.",
            "Grace would like to see more and more people learn this simple technique that has benefited her tremendously. At her centre, she offers a warm and welcomign space where individuals can learn this effortless practice and meet with other like-minded meditators.",
            "Whether you're looking to reduce stress, find your inner peace, improve focus, develop your leadership qualities, or enhance your overall well-being, you'll find a supportive environment with Grace - someone who truly understands the balance between corporate, life damands, and the joys of life."
